### DEV

1. Clone the repository

2. Run `yarn install`

3. Run `yarn dev`

This should compile the files to a dist folder. Given that this app is a chrome extension, to see your changes in the browser you have to load the extension in a chrome browser in developer mode.

### Loading the extension in chrome

1. In chrome, open a new tab and go to the following url -> [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)

2. Enable developer mode.

3. Next, click on the `load unpacked` button and select the dist folder in the `LNGIVEAWAY-FRONTEND` folder.

4. You should see the extension in the list of chrome extensions. You can pin the extension to easily access it.
